   <h3>PRNG Prediction</h3>
   <h3>January 2024 - Present</h3>
   <p class="project1-text">Early last year, I read about Cloudflare's use of lava lamps to generate random numbers. Around the same time, a few friends and I were getting together an ML project for a competition at our university. Proposing this idea to my friends, we debated whether this project would be very fruitful; after all, PRNGs are designed to be algorithmically unbreakable. My thought was that if a security/software/cloud security/cryptography company has switched away from using PRNGs, there must be this idea floating around of an underlying insecurity in the inherent "randomness" of PRNGs. Now, are these insecurities that we could possibly uncover? Who knows. We're working on that right now. So far, we've had non-negligible success (~61% bitwise accuracy) for a PRNG known as XORshift128. This PRNG is known to not be the most robust, so we're trying to extend our research to tougher PRNGs, hoping to eventually reach a level of predictive power for widely-used PRNGs such as Python's random module. I'll continue adding progress here in the meantime, so check back later!</p>

   <h3>Wildfire Dashboard</h3>
   <h3>April 2024</h3>
   <p class="about-text">Exactly what it sounds like</p>

   <h3>Criminal Sentencing Model</h3>
   <h3>April 2023</h3>
   <p class="about-text">There's not enough work out there using data for social issues. I'm not saying this one project is solving anything, but I'd like to think that even though it may just be a simple model with little technical advancements to show, I think the message is important. We've highlighted some biases in federal criminal sentencing procedures in the U.S. and used a simple multiple regression model to do so</p>
